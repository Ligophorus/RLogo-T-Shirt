# RLogo T-Shirt
## R script to design a T-shirt

This script was used to promote identity and motivation of students attending an R course at the University of Valencia. 

The R logo image required (Rlogo.png) can be downloaded from https://www.r-project.org/logo/

The script also requires library EBImage from Bioconductor.
To install EBImage, update to the latest release and enter the commands
``` 
install.packages("BiocManager") 
BiocManager::install("EBImage")
library(EBImage)    
```
Rlogo_curso2020.pdf shows the result.
